i am learning java programming language

these all characters are in upper case

ascii code for upper case characters - 65 to 90.

ascii code for lower case characters - 97 to 122.

we can simply convert upper case letter to lower case letter
by simply adding 32 to it's ascii code if the code of the letter
lies between 65 and 90, if not then it's already a lower case letter.
